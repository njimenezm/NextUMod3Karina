                  I don't mind if there's not much to say <br>

                  It's such a perfect day <br>
                  <br>
                  I remember <br>
                  We were walking up to strawberry swing <br>
                  I can't wait 'til the morning <br>
                  Wouldn't wanna change a thing
                </p>
                <p class="card-text col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12">
                  People moving all the time <br>
                  Inside a perfectly straight line <br>
                  Don't you wanna curve away <br>
                  It's such <br>
                  It's such a perfect day <br>
                  It's such a perfect day <br>
                  <br>
                  Now the sky could be blue <br>
                  I don't mind <br>
                  Without you it's a waste of time <br>
                  Could be blue <br>
                  <br>
                  I don't mind <br>
                  Without you it's a waste of time <br>
                  Could be blue, <br>
                  Could be grey <br>
                  Without you I'm just miles away <br>
                  <br>
                  Could be blue <br>
                  I don't mind <br>
